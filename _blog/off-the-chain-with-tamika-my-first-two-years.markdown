Dear LACBC fam,

![Tamika_First_Day.jpg](/uploads/Tamika_First_Day.jpg)

My first day at LACBC. December 22, 2014.

It was two years ago today that I was biking to the LACBC offices for my first day of work. At times, it feels like that wasn’t that long ago, and at other times, it feels like so much has changed since December 22nd, 2014. Over the past two years, our organization has grown to better serve cycling Angelenos across the county through organizing, advocacy, and education programs.

Your contribution will help us do even more in 2017 and beyond!

Here are a few highlights from my first two years here:

LACBC recognized as a national leader: This past year, LACBC received awards for our Mobility Plan 2035 and for our leadership in prioritizing equity. The accolades are appreciated, but what’s even better is hearing how other cities are looking to Los Angeles as a model for creating safe streets for the people that need it the most.

Measure M passes: This November, L.A. County residents overwhelmingly voted to pass Measure M, which provides approximately $120 billion over 40 years for transportation projects, including $4 billion for active transportation. This funding is crucial for completing biking and walking projects that LACBC will be working to implement.

L.A. becomes a Vision Zero City: Last year, the City of Los Angeles became a Vision Zero city, where the City vowed to aim for zero traffic fatalities by the year 2025. This marks a major shift from viewing traffic collisions, injuries, and fatalities as unpreventable.

Operation Firefly expands: Since 2012, LACBC’s Operation Firefly program has been helping people who don’t have the resources to get bike lights cycle safer at night. In 2013-14, we gave away 1,000 light sets. Last year, 2,600. We’re hoping to give away over 3,000 this year.

Bike Share debuts across the county: Santa Monica led the way last year, and since then, Long Beach, Beverly Hills, Downtown L.A., and West Hollywood all launched bike share, making our neighborhoods easier to explore by bike. Now we’re working with Multicultural Communities for Mobility to make Metro Bike Share in Downtown L.A. more equitable.

Meeting you all: From meetings to conferences to Sunday Funday rides, I have loved connecting with so many of you. You all inspire the LACBC staff and me to work harder each day and truly make all communities in L.A. county healthy, safe, and fun places to ride a bike.

Help us get there by making a contribution to LACBC today! Your tax-deductible donation by the end of 2016 will also automatically enter you to win an awesome bike from Pure Cycles.

Thank you for your continued support. From LACBC to you, happy holidays, and have a wonderful 2017!

P.S. It’s also my mom’s birthday today. And I love her. And she reads this because she’s an LACBC supporter. So happy birthday, Mom!
