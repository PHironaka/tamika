Dear LACBC Fam,

Happy 2016! I want to start off 2016 by using this space to say thank you. It is hard to believe that I am now in my second year at LACBC. Through your membership, your volunteering, your donations to our end-of-year campaign and throughout the year, and your kind messages, I am again reminded that I have the best job in the world. Looking back at 2015, I can see how lucky I am to be surrounded by amazing staff, board, members, and supporters.

So whether it was through becoming a member, making a donation, an event, a Sunday Funday ride, an email conversation, or just casually bumping into you when you are driving a Lyft and I’m your passenger, thank you. My job is meaningful because I’m doing work that I believe in to make Los Angeles great. I know you must feel the same way and, with every interaction we have, I’m energized to do more and continue to make LACBC stronger than we’ve ever been.

This year, we’re committed to upping our game, making streets safer, and working to achieve Vision Zero in L.A. We’re committed to ensuring that Mobility Plan 2035 brings the promise of complete streets. We’re committed to launching an amazing bike share program in DTLA. We’re committed to supporting our chapters as they grow and thrive. We’re committed to teaching LAUSD students how to ride safely. We’re committed to finding local climate solutions through Team LACBC’s participation in Climate Ride. We’re committed to having fun on the LA River Ride on June 12th. We’re committed to making invisible riders shine bright. We’re committed to keeping our members informed on any ballot initiatives that impact biking and walking. We’re committed to work on bicycling issues that are also social justice issues. We’re committed to keep talking about equity.

And more than anything. I’m committed to you. Here’s to another year of fun, success, hard work, and being an organization that you’re proud to be a member of and support. Thank you.

Keep pedaling,

Tamika Butler
LACBC Executive Director
